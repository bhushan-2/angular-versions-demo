                <label>1. Nullish Coalescing</label>
                <p>
                  The nullish coalescing operator (??) has been assisting engineers with composing cleaner code in
                  TypeScript classes for some time now. One of the main highlights of this feature is that you can bring
                  the force of nullish coalescing to Angular templates in v12!
                </p>
                <p>Presently, in templates, engineers can utilize the new syntax structure to improve the complex
                  conditionals. For instance:</p>
                <div class="terminal">
                  <pre>{{nullishCoalescing}}</pre>
                </div>
              </div>

                <label>2. HTTP improvements</label>
                <p>
                  Angular 12 features its own list of intelligible names for HTTP status codes, in the form of a const
                  enum. Because of this new element, we can now utilize HttpStatusCode instead of introducing our own
                  solution to have human-readable names.

                <label>3. Styling improvements</label>
                <p>
                  Starting in v12, Angular components will now support inline Sass in the styles field of the @Component
                  decorator. Previously, Sass was only available in external resources due to the Angular compiler. To
                  enable this feature in your existing applications add "inlineStyleLanguage": "scss‚Äù to angular.json.
                  Otherwise, it will be available to new projects using SCSS.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, Angular Material and Angular CDK have internally adopted a new Sass module framework.
                  Finally, angular 12 now also supports Tailwind CSS.
