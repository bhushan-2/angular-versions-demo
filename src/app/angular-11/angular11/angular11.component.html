        <label>1. Automatic Inlining of Fonts</label>
        <p>
          To make your apps even faster by speeding up their first contentful
          paint, weâ€™re introducing automatic font inlining. During compile time
          Angular CLI will download and inline fonts that are being used and
          linked in the application. These new features of Angular 11 are
          enabled by default for production configuration.

        <label>2. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Support</label>
        <p>
          Hot Module Replacement is a mechanism that allows the modules to be
          replaced without a full browser refresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now during development the latest changes to components, templates and
          styles will be instantly updated into the running application. All
          without requiring a full page refresh. Data typed into forms are
          preserved as well as scroll position providing a boost to developer
          productivity.

        <label>3. Improved Reporting and Logging</label>
        <p>
          Angular has made changes to the builder phase reporting to make it
          even more helpful during development. We are bringing in new CLI
          output updates to make logs and reports easier to read.

        <label>4. Experimental Webpack 5 Support</label>
        <p>
          Angular 11 improvements involve a team that can opt-in to webpack v5.
          A webpack is used to incorporate countless documents into a single
          bundle or single record. Webpack version 5 is the latest version that
          was released a couple of months back. It still needs time to be
          stable. At the moment, one can experiment with module federation. This
          webpack v5 in the future will clear the path for:
        </p>
        <p>1. Faster builds and disk caching</p>
        <p>2. Smaller bundles with cjs tree-shaking</p>
